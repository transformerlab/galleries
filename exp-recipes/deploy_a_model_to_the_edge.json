  "notes": "# Deploy LLaMA 3.2 to Edge Devices (MLX)\n\n## Overview\nThis recipe demonstrates how to optimize and deploy the **LLaMA 3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit** model to edge devices using MLX optimization for Apple Silicon. It includes both edge optimization and evaluation components to ensure optimal performance in resource-constrained environments.\n\nTo get started, simply go to the **Workflows** page and click **Run** \u2014 the entire deployment process is automated for you.\n\n## Workflow Breakdown\nThe workflow consists of the following automated steps:\n\n1. **Edge Optimization**  \n   The model is optimized for edge deployment using AirLLM MLX server with specific edge optimizations, including memory management and inference acceleration.\n\n2. **Edge Performance Evaluation**  \n   The optimized model is evaluated on the MMLU benchmark to assess its performance in the edge configuration and ensure quality is maintained.\n\n## Understanding Edge Deployment\nThis recipe optimizes the model for edge deployment by:\n- **MLX Edge Optimization**: Leveraging Apple Silicon's specialized capabilities for edge computing\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized memory usage suitable for resource-constrained devices\n- **Inference Acceleration**: Specialized optimizations for real-time edge applications\n- **4-bit Quantization**: Already optimized model format for edge deployment\n\n## Using the Deployed Model\nAfter deployment optimization, the model will be configured for:\n- Efficient operation on Apple Silicon edge devices\n- Low-latency inference suitable for real-time applications\n- Minimal memory footprint for resource-constrained environments\n\n## Important Notes\n- This recipe is optimized for **Apple Silicon edge devices** (M1/M2/M3)\n- **MLX optimization** provides significant advantages for edge deployment on Mac hardware\n- The **4-bit quantized model** is already optimized for edge performance\n- Edge optimization maintains model quality while maximizing efficiency\n\n## Expected Outcomes\nAfter completing this deployment optimization, you'll have:\n- A LLaMA 3.2 model optimized specifically for Apple Silicon edge devices\n- Reduced memory footprint suitable for resource-constrained environments\n- Enhanced inference speeds appropriate for real-time edge applications\n- Performance metrics demonstrating edge optimization effectiveness\n- A production-ready model for deployment in Apple Silicon edge environments",
